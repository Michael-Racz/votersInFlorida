## Description 
The file FloridaVoters.html contains a Web Table of republican and democratic voters in varous counties in Florida. Write code that reads in this file as a **standard text file** and prints out the counties, along with the number of republican and democratic voters in those counties, sorted by the number of democratic voters. The output should look like this:

Note: numbers in the HTML file contain commas, but we got rid of them in order to do the sorting. Also this program strictly **Does not** use bs4 and only uses regular expressions to extract the voter data.
